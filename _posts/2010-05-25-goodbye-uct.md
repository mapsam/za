All is finished at the University of Cape Town! I had my last exam yesterday for my South African History class and two last week, which all went well (I think ☺). It really still hasn’t hit me yet that I have an entire month and a few days to travel and enjoy South Africa as I enjoyed it the first month here. Since school was pretty time consuming, I wasn’t able to do as much as I had originally when I got here, but now I have all the time in the world. I assume that the time is going to fly by though, so I want to take advantage of every last minute!

A couple weekends ago my roommates and I went to experience high tea at the Mount Nelson Hotel, which offers high tea every day from 2:00 till 6:00. We enjoyed a very nice afternoon/evening drinking all sorts of different teas and eating delicious finger food from he amazing buffet.

Last week we had our house formal at a local restaurant called Hello Sailor. We decided to have an entire night dedicated to the awesome people living in 197 Lower Main and all got dressed up. We chose the date last week because it was a day that people didn’t have finals the next day and everyone was able to join. The dinner was fantastic and we then made our way downtown to a bar/lounge/club called Hemisphere, which is on the top level of the Absa bank building. It gave an amazing view of the lit up city. Dancing with the roommates was fantastic as usual, but then it got even better. We were dancing and having a good time and all of a sudden, who else could it be, but Wayne Brady dancing next to us with some girls that he knew. It was AWESOME. He was a really nice guy apparently and some of the girls in the house got to ride back with his driver instead of taking a taxi.

I have been dominating the Green Market Square as of late and buying (too many) stereotypical African goods. I figure that many of them will become gifts but I will keep some for my wall at home. Soccer has cooled down after most leagues have finished in Europe and the Champions League is over. Next on the plate is the WORLD CUP. It is a nice calm before the storm, which is going to be pretty hectic around here. Every time I have been at the ticketing center going with other people, there has been a constant stream of people getting their tickets for games all around, so that is a good sign!

I can’t remember if I said this in my last post, but I have been planning on changing my ticket home to the end of June and it is now officially changed to the first of July! Once all of my roommates are gone, I figured it was going to be pretty sad around here, and I have plenty to do at home with the family at the cabin and my friends in Mahtomedi and in Madison. It will be a nice break before going back to class.

That’s all for now,
Ciao
