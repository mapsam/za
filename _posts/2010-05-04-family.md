It has been a very busy week since my family got here last Monday. We have been spending loads of time exploring the town and enjoying being with each other in Cape Town. The food has been phenomenal. I don't think I have actually been hungry before each of our meals since we have been eating quite a lot of good food. We started off the week with some days just exploring the city and seeing what the city center had to offer. We managed to get Table Mountain, Bo Kaap (malaysian neighborhood), Green Point, and Camps Bay done in the first full day. The next few days were spontaneous but ended up being busy with more and more things to do. Over the weekend we managed to do the Cape Peninsula tour all morning and afternoon and ate dinner at Cape to Cuba in Kalk Bay on the False Bay side of the cape. Sunday was spent driving through Stellenbosch winelands doing tastings and staying at one of the most romantic farmsteads I have ever seen. It was outfitted with loads of old comfortable furniture from the eighteen hundreds. We all had our own rooms, including myself with the previous master bedroom and an extremely large bathroom with a bath tub that I took full advantage of. All in all, it has been very fun having my family here to finally see where I have been these past three months. Sean and Max left on Monday afternoon but my parents are staying here through the weekend in a place in Rondebosch (close to UCT). I have been trying to balance out school work with family, but mostly family has been a priority. This week should be relaxing with my mom and dad since they are planning on doing stuff during the day while I am at class and we will get together once I am done.

This coming weekend we are going on a Safari out in the Karoo, which should be a blast! I will be happy to finally take my stereotypical African safari, ha. Here are some photos from the past week. Not a whole lot of time to expand on what we did since I am exhausted and about to fall asleep. I will do this another time...
