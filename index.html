    <h1>South Africa</h1>
    <p>For 6 months I lived in Cape Town, South Africa studying at the University of Cape Town. From January to July I met incredibly interesting people, explored the southern region of the continent of Africa, and embraced the World Cup as it enveloped the nation for a month. Below is my blog, originally posted here, and now permanently kept as a reminder of the adventures that await us around every corner.</p>
